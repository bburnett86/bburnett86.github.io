      Hi! My name is Breton Burnett, and this is my documentation of my experiences with code. I'd like you to know that as a writer, you should expect my blog to be delivered in unorthodox ways. I'm very fond of using a story to carry an ideal so there may be plenty of that. I've been coding for a little under a year, thus I'm sure calling myself a novice would be an exaggeration. What better opportunity than this to start with, grow with, and know a new person?

      So I'm sure you're wondering if you're a writer, why a tech blog? Well, I'm also a millennial on a never ending bliss for sustained happiness. Often times on that journey we find ourselves in places we'd never expect. I first started coding in the third grade, I was in A.N. Pritzker's gifted school. We had just gotten cutting edge technology (DSL), and now that the school was wired they let some of the kids learn HTML and make websites. One of those kids being me. Now, I never knew how much of a profound effect this would have on my life until later.

      Fast forward through my early and mid 20's it's the Spring of 2015, it's mild, mosquitos are hungry, and I've connected with a new way of creating. Sitting in front of my MacBook looking at a website my girlfriend introduced me to (codecademy) I'm making we website. Honestly, after working in customer service full time and being an unsuccessful artist part time, successfully creating anything was euphoric. Before I know it I'm finishing HTML/CSS, then Ruby, taking classes at technology incubator Blue 1647, and now I'm here. Days before I'll truly begin a career transition, toeing the line of anxiety and excitement, hand out, looking you in the eye. "Are you coming with me?"
