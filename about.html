      Hi! My name is Breton Burnett, and I'm not shy about using exclamation marks!!! I actually really enjoy using words, punctuation, really, most writing mechanics in non orthodox ways to see if communication still works, or is possibly improved.

      You're probably like, why's he so weird? I'm a poet, or as I'd say, I poet. I also playwright, and do a few other things that you'll see once I'm able to figure out how to add an active calandar to my page. Although I've worked primarily in the realm of education as it applies to writing, this is my first experience returning to an eduational institution in a while. Also, I never actually finished my bachelors (something on my future wish list of things to accomplish) in business.

      I guess something weird about me is although I write a lot, and my inner millenial thumbs through tumblr, I've never actively blogged. Right now, I'm just talking to you, breaking the fourth wall, attempting to share open, honest, experiences.
