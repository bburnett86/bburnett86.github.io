      <h3>Ruby Vs. JavaScript:</h3>
      <h5>Two Libraries, One Language</h5>
    </section>
    <p>
      <tab>Welcome</tab> to the World Code Library, as mandatory for first timers I will be your tour guide. Let me explain where you are. Here we store every code database known to man in physical form. To your left is a chair that someone forgot to code a color into, yes, it is clear at the moment. For obvious reasons our building is constantly growing and changing. As your tour guide, I am also the gate keeper, I will make sure that you have at least a basic understanding of libraries in at least two coding languages. We wouldn't want to just let you walk around here, a new guy wandered into the Python pit last week, and that didn't end well.
    </p>
    <p>
      <tab>What</tab> I'll be teaching today will be <strong>JavaScript Objects</strong> in comparison with <strong>Ruby Hashes</strong>. Now I know you're looking like, whoa, two different languages!? Yes, and it'll actually be surprisingly easy to learn about libraries by comparing the two. Now before we get started in the Library, click here: <a href ="../blog/blog_examples/j-v-r-example.html" target="_blank">Library Map</a>, to receive your pamphlet of exactly where we're going.
    </p>
    <p>
      <tab>Let's</tab> start with discussing exactly what libraries are in regards to programming. Libraries are what we call lists, in JavaScript and Ruby, that can be called upon to return corresponding values. Let's begin with <strong>Ruby Hashes</strong> as you may be a bit more familiar with those. As you can see at the top of your map we have a list of hopeful vacation destinations for your average 20 something independent music fan. Our hash is created when we name it <hash>vacation</hash> followed by the equal sign and curly brackets that hold the code. Inside of the curly brackets are the <keys>keys</keys> and their corresponding <keyValue>values</keyValue>. Now it's good to note that a key can have many values (i.e. each of these values being a small list), but a value can only belong to one key. In this example the keys and values are both strings, and thus we use the string <keys>"fall"</keys> to return the values [<keyValue>"Afropunk"</keyValue>, <keyValue>"Brooklyn"</keyValue>] from the <hash>vacation</hash> hash.
    </p>
    <p>
      <tab>On</tab> that same tangent, lets move on to our next Ruby Hash example. Here we have your standard Chicagoan's list of favorite sports teams. These keys all have one corresponding value. But there's something else, different here, can you tell what it is? With our <hash>favorite_teams</hash> hash we see that we can name as well as call your Ruby Hash Keys with symbols. For example if you'd like to know this example's favorite <keys>:football</keys> team you'd use the symbol <keys>:football</keys> with your <hash>favorite_teams</hash> hash. If we were to print <hash>favorite_teams</hash>[<keys>:football</keys>] it would return the string <keyValue>"Bears"</keyValue>. So just a recap, <strong>Ruby Hashes</strong> have a <keys>key</keys>/<value>value</value> relationship. Where <keys>keys</keys> can be named using strings and symbols, and there can be multiple <value>values</value> for each <key>key</key>.
    </p>
    <p>
      <tab>Next</tab> Let's discuss what <strong>Ruby Hashes</strong> have in common with <strong>JavaScript Objects</strong>. <strong>JavaScript Objects</strong> and <strong>Ruby Hashes</strong>: are both libraries, they store information based on a keyword, and they're constructed and called pretty similarly. Both the anatomy of the <strong>Hash</strong> and <strong>JavaScript Object</strong> both are named, followed by and equal sign and curly brackets that encapsulate their code. Both of these libraries also have the ability to run loops that allow you to do things with the lists. For example, both the Ruby (.each) and JavaScript (for) allow you to loop through all of the values in the respective libraries and do something with them under certain parameters. And although they have that, and many other things in common, you'll see, there's quite a few differences.
    </p>
    <p>
      <tab>Although</tab>, <strong>JavaScript Objects</strong> may look similar to <strong>Ruby Hashes</strong> even those similarities have different names. While <strong>Hashes</strong> have <keys>keys</keys> and <keyValue>value</keyValue> pairs, <strong>JavaScript Objects</strong> have <property>property</property> and <propertyValue>value</propertyValue> pair. Now both of them use the word <strong>"value"</strong>, which makes perfect sense you want to have a value returned to you. Also, although you can only use strings for <property>properties</property> you can call those <property>properties</property> of the <object>JavaScript Object</object> in two different ways. These two different ways of summoning information from our <object>object</object> are called dot notation and bracket notation (for semi-obvious reasons, just look long enough). When using the bracket notation your property can be anything as long as you call it using quotation marks to signify that it is a string. Also, just for reference, bracket notation works solely because no matter what you name your <property>property</property> it's turned into a string using the toString method. Now dot notation must have a <property>property</property> that is a valid JavaScript identifier i.e. a sequence of alphanumerical characters, also including the underscore ("_") and dollar sign ("$"), that cannot start with a number. When taking these two options into consideration, understand that this isn't like <strong>Hashes</strong> where you can use symbols and strings interchangeably. The dot notation is preferred because it works in compliance with JavaScripts identifiers, and the bracket notation should only be used if you absolutely must use a <property>property</property> that is not a JavaScript Identifier. Other differences you might notice, when you create a <strong>JavaScript Object</strong> it is prefaced with a "var" which is essentially a JavaScript identifier letting you know that hash is a variable and that variable's name is also the hash name.
    </p>
    <p>
      <tab>Those</tab> are the basics. Let's have a quick walk recap. <strong>JavaScript Objects</strong> and <strong>Ruby Hashes</strong> are libraries constructed similarly with a lot of the same functions, and a few things named differently. Where <hash>Ruby Hashes</hash> have <keys>Keys</keys>, <object>JavaScript Objects</object> have <property>properties</property>. The <keys>keys</keys> in <hash>Ruby Hashes</hash> can be named using either strings or symbols as you please. <object>Ruby Objects</object> can be called using either dot or bracket notation; however, dot notation is preferred, and bracket should only be used in situations where it is needed. In the end though, they're both libraries, and extremely useful. Now that you have a basic understanding of the libraries in our Library, feel free to enjoy the rest of our exhibits, but make sure you get a guide.
