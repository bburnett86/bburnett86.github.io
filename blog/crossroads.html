        <h3>The Crossroads</h3>
    </section>
    <p>
      In a world filled with libraries, how will you design your page? When you document your experiences, what are you thinking will connect with people? How can blog become Behemoth? Well, it's a matter of consistency, design, and content. I'll tell you how I've developed mine.
    </p>
    <p>
      When looking at personal blogs I realized I have a love for simplicity. The more I looked at things like Huffington Post and Mashable the more I became overwhelmed with the sheer diversity of pictures and topics. I'm indecisive, I also really enjoy text and having the ability to focus in on one thing at a time. Honestly, my ideal market would think like me, and enjoy my site for those reasons. I'm a Tumblr scrolling, Twitter finger, Instagram lurking, inactive Facebook account. Now the last one has more to do with my great aunts and uncles adding me as friends than it does content or design. Either way, I'm really fond of websites that allow you to scroll, browse, and enjoy at your leisure, most mainstream blogs feel like they're forcing content down my throat.

      Speaking of my preferred design, you'd be surprised how easy it is to mismanage one page's layout and have it effect every blog after. Make sure that you're consistently using the same blog template. At one juncture I mistakenly eliminated the name of my blog from the blog post template. It didn't look horrible, my website wasn't ruined. My website also is still a work in progress, not a source of revenue, and more or less a hobby. Meaning, if it is something you take seriously, is work related, or your income depends on it, make sure you don't mess up your templates because people are very picky about those. Also, doing something that doesn't seem so obviously wrong can still definitely throw off the feel of the website on the next page. Things that the user has become comfortable with and are starting to associate with your site may be throw awry and that's not what you want at all.
    </p>

      Lastly I'd like to discuss content. As you can probably tell by this juncture I like to tell a story to help get my point across. I generally find they're a bit more entertaining than straight instructions, and if I can articulate it correctly it usually lets me know that I understand it. This is completely and totally not necessary. Be yourself. I personally think my blog is clever and pretty funny, you may think I'm pretentious and obnoxious, and because it's subjective we're both right! All jokes aside, what I'm saying is especially if this is a personal blog, be yourself, it'll make writing easier, and you'll feel accomplished when you've finished. Because even if you perfect your sites design, have it continuous, with content you think is great, entertainment is subjective, and you wont make everyone happy. Might as well start with yourself.
