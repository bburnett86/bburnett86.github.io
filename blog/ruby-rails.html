      <tab>So</tab>, let's recap cause we rarely do. This has been on crazy journey: we started at the GitHub super highway; exited at bordering countries HTML and CSS; backpacked through Ruby; and had a Triple, Venti, Half Sweet, Non-Fat, Caramel Macchiato in JavaScript. Once we arrived there, although they spoke different languages we found out how much the libraries in JavaScript had in common with those in Ruby. They actually had a lot of things in common in those to places overall. So many, that here we are, back in Ruby City and they just finished a mode of transportation that can take us to places we've never gone before. They say that once we've learned how to travel on this we can go to some of the most complex places in Programlandia, they call it, Rails.

      <tab>Rails</tab> is a software library that extends the Ruby programming language to allows you to build websites. The keys to operating rails is learning how to use the conventions which are coded as Rails APIs. These conventions are what make it easy for us to collaborate with Ruby and maintain the website. Rails combines Ruby programming with CSS and HTML and JavaScript to create a web application that runs on a web server. Because Rails runs on a server it's a "back-end" web application development platform. In case you were wondering the "front-end" is the web browser (web design). From everything I've gathered rails is a back-end web application development platform created to make it easier to make complex websites, and easier to manage them.
