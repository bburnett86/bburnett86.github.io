  		<h3>Blogging 101</h3>
  		<p>
        			This first week has been a wonderful learning experience. Between time management, command lines, git/github, I'm beginning the path to embracing confusion. Luckily I'm excited that I know what to do with the confusion, and how to effectively channel that energy; in spurts with rest. Eitherway, we're here specifically today to talk about version control, git and github.

          			Luckily these three things are all interconnected, so this should be relatively well flowing (I have time management puns for days... See what I did there?). So, version control is a system that records changes to a file so that it can be recalled later. Think of it as when you had a Playstation one, and every save file was done so with a time stamp. You had all the ability to go back to your file and start from wherever you were as Cloud in Final Fantasy VII. Version control allows you to do that with pretty much anything, whether it be a story, a recipe, website, ect. This is where git comes into play. Git is a free version control system that can be run through your command line. Git allows you to go back in versions of your file for everytime you commit that file. Github serves the exact same purpose as git, except it does so online so that you are able to share the inforation with several people simultaneously as well as work on it together. As long as everyone works on their specific different part of the code, everyone should be fine.
