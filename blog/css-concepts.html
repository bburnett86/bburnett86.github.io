		<h3> Margins and Borders and Padding!? Oh My!</h3>

      			My second blog entry is done after getting much deeper into the code for HTML and CSS. Today specifically I would like to explain to you the difference between Margins, Borders, and Padding. Above I have a visual display for you that you can reference as you read through this if ever you feel you need clarity.

        			So, let's start with a metaphor. Everyone has seen the tootsie roll commercials right? One, twooooooo, two... Then the Owl steals from the little boy. Eitherway, your content is the tootsie roll center, its the part in the middle that everyone is trying to get to. Your margins, borders, and padding are the sweet sweet candy on the outside surrounding it, but there's levels. Actually, it'd be more like a never ending gob stopper where it changes colors as you get towards the middle. Eitherway, what I'm getting at is the most important thing here is your content. Your content attracts your market, keeps them on the page, gives it personality. From that point on you can dress your content up however you like. This is where we get into padding. Say you want to make a box around your content, but you don't want the box to rub right up against your words. Around that content you would put padding, which would let the website know how much space to put between your words and the box. And the technical term for your box is a border. The border is essentially the line that surrounds the padding to the content. But the border can be dressed up in many ways whether it's a straight line, dashed line, or even transparent. Lastly, you have your margin. The margin is what separates one content box from another content box. Say you want to have a huge title on the top and the paragraph way down the page, you'd put in huge margins on the bottom to create that space. I hope this helped you some!
