        Welcome to the Wonderful World of Ruby!
      </p>
      <p><tab>
        This is our first journey into logic where our footsteps leave ifs and elses. When it's not a decision we walk into words where if we want we can analyze each one down to the letter. But a question we’re asked once we arrive is. What is difference between a hash and an array?
      </p>
      <p><tab>
        Well you know that hashes are sets of key and value pairs that determine what key is associated with what value when one is called. You also know that an array is an ordered list set by their number in the array beginning at zero. And to the naked eye, it looks like just that, like these are just two lists.
      </p>
      <p>
        You then realize the difference is in calling the object you’re looking for. With an array you have to remember exactly where the object is located in the array. If you call the first value, it’s more than likely going to have a completely different object associated with it than the second, third, and so forth. On the other hand with a has you’d call the key associated with the value as there is no set determined numeric order. No matter where :HoneyCrisp is located Apple will come up when it’s called if that’s they’re key value pair. There! That’s is! As you wander through Ruby walk into an academy… Classes.
