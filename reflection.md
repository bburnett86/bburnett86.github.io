What did you learn about CSS padding, borders, and margin by doing this challenge?

Because the simplicity of the index page of my website I did not learn much about padding, borders, or margins because I didn't utilize any tables. However, in going through the exercises previously with the rectangles I definitely got to understand how they would relate to positioning items on your website using CSS.

What did you learn about CSS positioning?
With CSS positioning I learned how easy it would be to position words into the correct areas that you wanted them on the website. Although, I haven't figured out why having auto'd my margins on my image didn't get it to center (I actually had to do trail and error with ems) it still made it possible never the less. Also, I've realized it's pretty easy to keep up with what part of the website you're styling if you use the HTML 5 Semantic Elements as they are logically named after what they are.

What aspects of your design did you find easiest to implement? What was most difficult?
CSS as a whole was pretty easy to do in terms of the basics as longa as you remembered:
selector{
	property: value;
}

If you have those basics it's pretty hard to go wrong. The hardest part was probably formatting div blocks, as you have to have a real understanding not only of what they do but also the effect of what you're applying to them.

What did you learn about adding and formatting elements with CSS in this challenge?
Adding and formatting elements was probably the most fun. Being able to design the website and change the text was really nice to implement and made me feel like I took a step out of the 56k modem age. It's really nice to be able to give our websites character.
