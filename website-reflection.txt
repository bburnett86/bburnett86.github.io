In this lesson we learned about creating repositories for our first website. For the most part creating the repository was the easy part. You really just open the github website, and on the top of the website between your user icon and notifications is a plus sign, from which you choose create new repository. Once your'e in there it's really a matter of choosing a repository name and deciding whether you want the repository to be public or private as well as determining it's licensing. It's licensing is important in terms of determining if it can be used for open source. Open source is sharing how a program was made and allowing anyone to customize the program as they see fit. Which can be phenomenal as it allows outsiders to update your code and potentially make your code into things you could have never imagined. Which makes licensing even more important because it gives different levels of access to the code. Whether it's something you want to be able to share completely with the world, or just let the world use, it can all be determined by the level of licensing put on the product.
